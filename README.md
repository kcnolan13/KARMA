KARMA

Kyle's AAMPS Real-time Map App


KARMA has been designed to help task-saturated AOC  flight crews make better, faster decisions.


All supporting source for the software package is contained in one root directory, KARMA, designed to reside in the Tile Serverâ€™s home folder. This ~/KARMA/ directory contains the two major facets of the project as it exists today:

~/KARMA/karma/: The C++ application that logs AAMPS data from the Data Distribution Server (DDS) to a PostgreSQL database (entitled flight_archive).

~/KARMA/server/: All sources related to the client-facing user interface suite.


In traditional AAMPS data system fashion, ~/KARMA/karma/ contains karma.cpp source code, supported by a handful of classic helper files (e.g. global.h, Message.cpp, Message.h, TLV.cpp, TLV.h, etc.). The ~/KARMA/karma/Release/ subdirectory contains a Makefile, the compiled source code, and several config files.

Meanwhile, ~/KARMA/server/ contains an assortment of routines and dynamically generated map assets necessary for proper User Interface (UI) operation. This directory is made network-accessible via Apache webserver through use of a symbolic link. This link, pointing to ~/KARMA/server/, resides in the default web content location -- either /var/www/ or /var/www/html/, depending on the individual Apache installation.

~/KARMA/server/ also has a subdirectory ~/KARMA/server/icons/,  containing a myriad of UI graphics, including a large folder of PHP-generated wind barb icons.
